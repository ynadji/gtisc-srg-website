= SRG Website =
I wrote a quick little python script to generate the body of the SRG webpage
with quick customizations. The primary benefit is getting the dates right
The code should be self-explanatory:

$ python schedulegen.py --help
Usage: schedulegen.py [options] firstday lastday

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o ORGANIZER, --organizer=ORGANIZER
  -e EMAIL, --email=EMAIL
  -w WEBSITE, --website=WEBSITE
  -l LOCATION, --location=LOCATION
  -t TIME, --time=TIME

firstday/lastday work with a MM/DD/YYYY format, I'm sure the parser handles
other forms as well. All the other arguments are strings. Check the code for
sane defaults. The page is printed to stdout.
